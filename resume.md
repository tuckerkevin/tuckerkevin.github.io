TekTone designs and manufactures nurse call and wireless emergency call systems.

### Accomplishments

My years at TekTone have provided me with a great opportunity to develop my skills as a software developer, leader and catalyst for change within the company.

In the past, TekTone developed each new system with no interoperability with their existing systems. I lead an effort to break this paradigm and integrate these systems on a common platform. Now everything including our [entry-level stations][tekcare120], our [top-of-the-line stations][tekcare400p5], our [wireless devices][tekcare500], as well as legacy products and third party systems interoperate as part of one platform. The development and release of this single platform to unify our product line:

- enables us to market new features to existing customers
- ensures that our investments in development and support add value across our entire product line, such as with our [mobile application][tekcareapp]
- enables our customers to use a single system across their various care levels

I am constantly learning and evaluating new technologies to utilize in our development process and products. I work closely with hardware engineers and at times involve myself in mechanical design to ensure a great final product. Most importantly, in my role as Software Development Manager, I:

- serve as manager for our entire team of software developers in the engineering department
- ensure our various software components are designed to work together as a cohesive system
- assign tasks to our developers in a way to best utilize their unique skills while providing them with challenges and opportunities for growth and career development
- coordinate the timeline of the various software projects so that our release deadlines are met
- communicate with stakeholders on the status of ongoing projects
