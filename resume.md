| **Software Engineer / Software Coordinator** | 2008 - Present |
| **Software Engineer**                        | 2003 - 2008    |
| [TekTone Sound & Signal Mfg., Inc.][tektone] |                |

TekTone designs and manufactures nurse call and wireless emergency call systems.

### Accomplishments

My years at TekTone have provided me with a great opportunity to develop my skills as a software developer, leader and catalyst for change within the engineering department.

In the past, TekTone developed each new system with no interoperability with their existing systems. I lead an effort to break this paradigm and integrate these systems on a common platform. Now everything including our [low-end stations][tekcare110], our [high-end stations][tekcare400p5], our [wireless devices][tekcare500] and [third party systems][tekalert] interoperate as part of one platform. The development and release of this single platform to unify our product line:

- enables us to market new features to existing customers
- ensures that our investments in development and support add value across our entire product line
- enables our customers to use a single system across their various care levels

I am constantly learning and evaluating new technologies to utilize in our development process and products. I work closely with hardware engineers and at times involve myself in mechanical design to ensure a great final product. Most importantly, in my role as Software Coordinator, I:

- ensure our various software components are designed to work together as a cohesive system
- assign tasks to our developers in a way to best utilize their unique skills while providing them with challenges and opportunities for growth
- coordinate the timeline of the various software projects so that our release deadlines are met
