# About Me

My name is Kevin Tucker. I live in the mountains of Western North Carolina.

I am a motorcycle enthusiast. I enjoy running, hiking, backpacking, photography, sour beer, good food and electronic music. I am a dog person.

## Vocation

I work at [TekTone](http://tektone.com) where I serve as both *Software Engineer* and *Software Coordinator*. My primary focus is on embedded systems, but our software platform includes a little bit of everything, and I work on all of it.
