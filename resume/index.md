[Employee Spotlight: Kevin Tucker](http://tektone.com/tektalk102.htm#article2)

### Projects
[*Tek-CARE 400/Tek-CARE 400 P5*](http://tektone.com/tekcare400.htm) *(modular distributed nurse-call system):* Modules distributed throughout a facility function as a single system while providing a fault tolerant and scalable architecture. The entire system is plug and play with a functional default configuration.

[*Tek-CARE 500*](http://tektone.com/tekcare500.htm) *(wireless emergency call system):* This legacy system has been reimplemented on the Tek-CARE 400 code base to support co-development and facilitate interaction between the two historically separate systems.

[*Tek-ALERT*](http://tektone.com/blog/archives/1392) *(integration system):* This user-extensible system provides a uniform monitoring, messaging, and reporting platform in which both TekTone and third party systems can interoperate.

*LS450* *(configuration tool):* This desktop application is used to upgrade, configure, synchronize, merge, and backup configurations on the Tek-CARE 400, Tek-CARE 500, and Tek-ALERT systems.

[*NC402TS*](http://tektone.com/blog/archives/1380) *(master station):* This ARM based touch-screen master station is the primary user interface to the Tek-CARE 400/Tek-CARE 400 P5 system.

### Accomplishments

Although TekTone is a small company, it has provided me with a good opportunity for growth. In my years at TekTone, I have been a positive force for change in the Engineering Department. Together we have improved the quality of software we develop and the processes we use to develop it.

In the past, TekTone developed each new system with no interoperability with their existing systems. I lead an effort to break this paradigm and integrate these systems on a common platform. [Now everything including our low-end stations, our high-end stations, our wireless devices, and third party systems interoperate as part of one platform.](http://tektone.com/blog/archives/660) The development and release of this single platform to unify our fragmented product line has been one of biggest contributions I have made to the company.
